**Day 15:** Bianry Trees & BST Implementation.

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. Create a Binary Tree class and define a method for each of the depth first traversals: pre-order, in-order,
post-order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately. Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors.

Create a Binary Search Tree class: This class should be a sub-class of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods: Add, Arguments: value, Return: nothing, Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree. Contains - Argument: value, and returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
