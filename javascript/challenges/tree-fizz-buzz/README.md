**Day 18:** Fizz Buzz Tree.

We write a function called Fizz Buzz that takes in a K-ary tree as an argument and returns a new K-ary tree. The function should traverse the tree and determine whether the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”. If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”. If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”. If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
