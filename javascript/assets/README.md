# All Whiteboards can be found here-

**Day 1:** [Array Reverse](array-reverse.png)

We had to reverse an array.

**Day 2:** [Insert Shift Array](insert-shift-array.png)

We have to insert an element into the middle of an array.

**Day 3:** [Array Binary Search](array-binary-search.png)

We are asked to search for a target value within a sorted array.

**Day 4:** Whiteboard Challenge with peer

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer.

**Day 5:** [Linked List Implementation](Linked-lists.png)

We created a linked linked list with ability to add and delete and traverse.

**Day 6:** [linked List Add/Insert](Linked-lists.png)

We add nodes to the end and insert a node before and after a specific node.

**Day 7:** - [linked List K-th](linked-list-kth.png)

We add nodes to the kth postionn away using a 'number' as arguament and 'k' as our parameter.

**Day 8:** [linked List Zip](challenges/LL-Zip/linked-list-zip.js)

- Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.

**Day 9:** Whiteboard Challenge with peer

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer.

**Day 10:** [Stacks-and-Queues](Data-Structures/stacksAndQueues/stacks-and-queues.js)

- Implement both a Stack and a Queue. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

**Day 11:** [pseudoQueues](challenges/pseudoQueue/pseudoQueue.js)

- We implement both a new class called a pseudoQueue. Utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue by using the enqueue and the dequeue.

**Day 12:** [Animal Shelter](assets/AnimalShelter.png)

- We create a class Animal Shelter which holds only cats and dogs. Operate using FIFO. Will enqueue animal if it's a cat or dog. Will dequeue using pref as argumanet of cat or dog.

**Day 13:** [Validate Brackets](challenges/ValidateBrackets/validateBrackets.js)

- We Write a function called validate brackets that takes in a argument as a string, and returns a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets: Round: `()` Square: `[]` & Curly: `{}`.

**Day 14:** Whiteboard Challenge with peer

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer, working on the Duck Duck Goose problem. Counting begins at a point and proceeds around the circle. After a specified number of people skipped, the next person is removed. This continues until one person is left.

**Day 15** [Trees](assets/tree.png)

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. Create a Binary Tree class and define a method for each of the depth first traversals: pre-order, in-order,
post-order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately. Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors.

- Create a Binary Search Tree class: This class should be a sub-class of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods: Add, Arguments: value, Return: nothing, Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree. Contains - Argument: value, and returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

**Day 16:** [Max Value](assets/MaxValue.png)

- We write a function to find the maximum value stored in the tree. Binary Tree will be numeric.

**Day 17:** [Breadth First](assets/breadth-first.png)

- We write a function called Breadth first that returns a list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered.

**Day 18:** [Fizz Buzz Tree](assets/fizz-buzz.png)

- We write a function called Fizz Buzz that takes in a K-ary tree as an argument and returns a new K-ary tree where the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and replace the value with “Fizz”, "Buzz”, or “FizzBuzz”. If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

**Day 19:** Whiteboard Challenge with peer

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer, working on how to find and return the sum of all odd numbers in a Bianry Search Tree using the depth-first or breadth first methods.
- [Sum of all Odd #'s](assets/code-challenge-19.png)

**Day 20:** [Insetion Sort](../javascript/assets/insertionSort/InsertionSort.png)

- We're given pseudocode, and make an algorithm and step through the process with a provided sample array. We document our explanation by writing a blog article.

**Day 21:** [Merge Sort](../javascript/assets/mergeSort/mergeSort.png)

- We're given pseudocode, and make an algorithm and step through the process with a provided sample array. We document our explanation by writing a blog article.

**Day 22:** [Quick Sort](../javascript/assets/quickSort/QuickSort.png)

- We're given pseudocode, and make an algorithm and step through the process with the provided sample array. We then document our explanation by writing a blog article.

**Day 23:** Whiteboard Challenge with peer

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer, working on how to implement mergeSort function.
- [MergeSort](/assets/Wtbrd.challenge-23.png)

**Day 24:** [hash Table](../javascript/assets/hashtable.png)

- We implement a Hash Table with the following methods: `set`, `get`, `contains`, `keys`, and `hash`.

**Day 25:** [Repeated Word](../assets/Repeated-word.png)

- We write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string. It takes in a string as argument and returns a string.
