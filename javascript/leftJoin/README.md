**Day 27:** Left Join

Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

We write a function called left join that takes in 2 parameters. The first is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as its value. The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values. The returned data structure holds the key:value pairs from the first hashmap and the values of those keys from the second. Null is used if no value is in the second hashmap.

<u>*Big O:*</u>

Time: 0(n*log(n))

Space: 0(n)
