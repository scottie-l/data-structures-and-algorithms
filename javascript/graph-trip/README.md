**Day 31:** Graph Business trip

We write a function called business trip that takes graph and an array of city names, and returns the cost, or null. We determine whether the trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.

- Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights?
- If so, how much will the total trip cost be?
