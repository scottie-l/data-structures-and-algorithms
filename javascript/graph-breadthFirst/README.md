**Day 30:** Breadth First Graph Traversal

We traveser through a graph. The method will be breadth first and take no arguments. It will return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. They will display the collection at the end of the method.

<u>*Big O:*</u>

- V: vertices
- E: edges

Time: 0(V + E)

Space: 0(V + E)
