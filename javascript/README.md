**Day 4:** Mock Interview

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer.

**Day 5:** Linked List implentation

- We created a linked linked list with ability to add and delete and traverse.

- [Linked List Solution](Data-Structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js)

**Day 6:** Linked list insertions

- We add nodes to the end and insert a node before and after a specific node.

- [Linked List Insertions Solution](Data-Structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js)

**Day 7:** Linked list kth.

- We add nodes to the kth postionn away using a 'number' as arguament and 'k' as our parameter.

- [Linked List-kth Solution](Data-Structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js)

**Day 8:** Linked list zip.

- Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.

- [Linked List Zip Solution](challenges/LL-Zip/linked-list-zip.js)

**Day 9:** Whiteboard Challenge with peer

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer.

**Day 10:** Linked-list; Stacks and Queues

- Implement both a Stack and a Queue. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

- [Stacks and Queues Solution](Data-Structures/stacksAndQueues/stacks-and-queues.js)

**Day 11:** PseudoQueues

- We implement both a new class called a pseudoQueue. Utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue by using the enqueue and the dequeue.
- [Pseudo Queues Whiteboard](assets/stacks-and-queues.png)
- [Pseudo Queues Solution](challenges/pseudoQueue/pseudoQueue.js)

**Day 12:** Animal Shelter

- We create a class Animal Shelter which holds only cats and dogs. Operate using FIFO. Will enqueue animal if it's a cat or dog. Will dequeue using pref as argumanet of cat or dog.

- [Animal Shelter Solution](challenges/AnimalShelter/animal-shelter.js)

**Day 13:** Validate Brackets

- We Write a function called validate brackets that takes in a argument as a string, and returns a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets: Round: `()` Square: `[]` & Curly: `{}`.

- [Validate Brackets Solution](challenges/ValidateBrackets/validateBrackets.js);

**Day 14:** Whiteboard Challenge with peer

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer, working on the Duck Duck Goose problem. Counting begins at a point and proceeds around the circle. After a specified number of people skipped, the next person is removed. This continues until one person is left.
- [DuckDuckGoose](assets/code-challenge14.png);

**Day 15** Trees

- We create a Binary Tree class and define a method for each of the depth first traversals: pre-order, in-order, post-order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately. Also create a Binary Search Tree class with the following additional methods: Add, Arguments: value, Return: nothing, Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

- [Tree Solution](challenges/Trees/Trees.js)

**Day 16:** We write a function to find the maximum value stored in the tree. Binary Tree will be numeric.
- [Find Maximum Value Whiteboard](assets/MaxValue.png)
- [Tree Solution](challenges/Trees/Trees.js)

**Day 17:** We write a function called Breadth first that returns a list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered.
- [Breadth First Whiteboard](assets/breadth-first.png)
- [Tree Solution](challenges/Trees/Trees.js)

**Day 18:** We write a function called Fizz Buzz that takes in a K-ary tree as an argument and returns a new K-ary tree where the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and replace the value with “Fizz”, "Buzz”, or “FizzBuzz”. If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
