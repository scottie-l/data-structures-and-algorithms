**Day 4:** Mock Interview
A mock whiteboard interview with a peer.

**Day 5:** Linked List implentation.
We created a linked linked list with ability to add and delete and traverse.

**Day 6:** Linked list insertions.
We add nodes to the end and insert a node before and after a specific node.

**Day 7:** Linked list kth.
We add nodes to the kth postionn away using a 'number' as arguament and 'k' as our parameter.

**Day 8:** Linked list zip.
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.

**Day 9:** Whiteboard Challenge with peer
A mock whiteboard interview with a peer.

**Day 10:** Linked-list; Stacks and Queues
Challenge: Implement both a Stack and a Queue. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
- [stacks-and-queues](https://github.com/scottie-l/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main/javascript/Data-Structures/stacksAndQueues)

**Day 11:** PseudoQueues
We implement both a new class called a pseudoQueue. Utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue by using the enqueue and the dequeue.
