**Day 1:** reverse array

- We had to reverse an array. [array-reverse](assets/array-reverse.png)

**Day 2:** array insert shift

- We have to insert an element into the middle of an array. [insert-shift-array](assets/insert-shift-array.png)

**Day 3:** array-binary-search

- We are asked to search for a target value within a sorted array. [array-binary-search](assets/array-binary-search.png)

**Day 4:** Mock Interview

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer.

**Day 5:** Linked List implentation

- We created a linked linked list with ability to add and delete and traverse. [linked-list](Data-Structures/linked-lists/linked-list.js)

**Day 6:** Linked list insertions

- We add nodes to the end and insert a node before and after a specific node.

  - [linked-list Whiteboard](assets/Linked-lists.png)

**Day 7:** Linked list kth.

- We add nodes to the kth postionn away using a 'number' as arguament and 'k' as our parameter.

**Day 8:** Linked list zip.

- Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list. [linked-list-zip](challenges/LL-Zip/linked-list-zip.js)

**Day 9:** Whiteboard Challenge with peer

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer.

**Day 10:** Linked-list; Stacks and Queues

- Implement both a Stack and a Queue. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node. [stacks-and-queues](Data-Structures/stacksAndQueues/stacks-and-queues.js)

**Day 11:** PseudoQueues

- We implement both a new class called a pseudoQueue. Utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue by using the enqueue and the dequeue. [pseudoQueues](challenges/pseudoQueue/pseudoQueue.js)

**Day 12:** Animal Shelter

- We create a class Animal Shelter which holds only cats and dogs. Operate using FIFO. Will enqueue animal if it's a cat or dog. Will dequeue using pref as argumanet of cat or dog. [Animal Shelter](challenges/AnimalShelter/animal-shelter.js)

**Day 13:** Validate Brackets

- We Write a function called validate brackets that takes in a argument as a string, and returns a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets: Round: `()` Square: `[]` & Curly: `{}`. [Validate Brackets](challenges/ValidateBrackets/validateBrackets.js);

**Day 14:** Whiteboard Challenge with peer

- A mock whiteboard interview with a peer, working on the Duck Duck Goose problem. Counting begins at a point and proceeds around the circle. After a specified number of people skipped, the next person is removed. This continues until one person is left. [DuckDuckGoose](assets/code-challenge14.png);

**Day 15** Trees

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. Create a Binary Tree class and define a method for each of the depth first traversals: pre-order, in-order,
post-order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately. Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors.

Create a Binary Search Tree class: This class should be a sub-class of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods: Add, Arguments: value, Return: nothing, Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree. Contains - Argument: value, and returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
